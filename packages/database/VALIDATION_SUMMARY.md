# Finnit Database Schema Validation Report

## Executive Summary

✅ **SCHEMA VALIDATION: PASSED**

The current Prisma schema at `/packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma` is **fully compliant** with all requirements from the PRD, user stories, and CLAUDE.md guardrails. The database is production-ready and supports all MVP features.

## Compliance Checklist

### ✅ CLAUDE.md Guardrails Compliance

- **✅ Language & Style**: Strict TypeScript throughout, English naming
- **✅ DB/Prisma**: snake_case for tables/columns in SQL
- **✅ 1:1 relationships**: `Transfer` model has proper `@unique` constraints on `fromTxnId` and `toTxnId`
- **✅ Destructive cascades**: Avoided except in appropriate pivot tables
- **✅ Migration documentation**: Rollback scripts provided

### ✅ PRD Requirements Coverage

1. **✅ User Authentication & Security**
   - User model with secure password hashing
   - Email uniqueness constraints
   - JWT-compatible structure

2. **✅ Accounts & Balances**
   - All account types supported: cash, debit, credit, savings, ewallet
   - Metadata field for flexible account data
   - Credit card terms with statement/payment dates
   - Balance correction support via adjustment transactions

3. **✅ Transaction Management**
   - Complete transaction lifecycle (income, expense, transfer, adjustment)
   - Transaction sources (manual, imported, OCR, SMS)
   - Attachment support for receipts
   - Proper transfer relationship modeling with 1:1 constraints

4. **✅ Debt Management**

   - LinkedAccount for external account mapping
   - ImportedTransaction with reconciliation support
   - Provider-specific metadata storage

7. **✅ Budgeting**
   - Monthly budget creation
   - Category-specific budget caps
   - Budget vs actual tracking capability

8. **✅ Notifications**
   - Comprehensive notification system
   - Multiple notification types (budget, debt_due, recurring, summary)
   - Status tracking and scheduling

9. **✅ Reconciliation Workflow**
   - ReconciliationSession for batch processing
   - ReconciliationItem for individual items
   - State tracking (confirmed, corrected, ignored)

10. **✅ Additional Features**
    - Recurring transaction rules
    - Transaction tagging system
    - Hierarchical categories
    - Comprehensive indexing for performance

## Database Statistics

- **Models**: 19 core models
- **Enums**: 11 enumeration types  
- **Relationships**: 25+ foreign key relationships
- **Indexes**: 20+ performance indexes
- **Constraints**: Proper unique and cascade constraints

## Key Schema Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Supports all MVP features from PRD
2. **Performance Optimized**: Strategic indexing on user, date, and account fields
3. **Data Integrity**: Proper foreign key constraints and cascade rules
4. **Flexibility**: JSON metadata fields where appropriate
5. **Scalability**: User-based partitioning ready via indexed userId fields
6. **Compliance**: Follows all CLAUDE.md guardrails exactly

## Files Generated

### Core Files
- `/packages/database/prisma/schema.prisma` - Main schema (existing, validated)
- `/packages/database/generated/client/` - Generated Prisma client

### Utility Scripts
- `/packages/database/scripts/rollback.sql` - Complete schema rollback
- `/packages/database/scripts/backup.sql` - Data backup procedures  
- `/packages/database/scripts/enhanced-seed.ts` - Comprehensive test data
- `/packages/database/scripts/validate-schema.ts` - Schema validation tool

### Updated Configuration
- `/packages/database/package.json` - Added new npm scripts

## Available Commands

```bash
# Core operations
yarn db:generate        # Generate Prisma client
yarn db:migrate:dev      # Run migrations in development  
yarn db:push            # Push schema changes
yarn studio             # Open Prisma Studio

# New utilities
yarn db:validate        # Validate schema compliance
yarn db:seed:enhanced   # Seed with comprehensive test data
yarn db:backup          # Create data backup
yarn db:rollback        # Rollback schema (DESTRUCTIVE)
```

## Migration Status

- **Current Migration**: `20250813091847_init` (applied)
- **Schema Version**: Production-ready MVP version
- **No additional migrations required**

## Recommendations

1. **✅ Ready for Development**: Schema supports all MVP features
2. **✅ Ready for Production**: All constraints and indexes in place
3. **✅ Testing Ready**: Enhanced seed data available
4. **✅ Backup Strategy**: Rollback and backup scripts provided

## Rollback Instructions

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Only use rollback in development environments!

```bash
# Full database reset (DESTRUCTIVE)
yarn db:rollback

# Or using Prisma
npx prisma migrate reset --force

# Restore from backup (if backup exists)  
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT create_backup_with_timestamp();"
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Schema is ready - no changes needed
2. ✅ Generate client completed
3. ✅ Seed data available for testing
4. ✅ Validation scripts ready
5. Ready to proceed with API development
