Ensure everything is green and PRs are open:
1) Run tests; fix lints/types.
2) Verify migrations apply cleanly; include rollback notes in each PR body.
3) Create/refresh PR descriptions with: summary, risks, affected migrations, test steps, rollback.
4) If GitHub Action for Claude is installed, mention @claude in each PR to auto-summarize and run follow-ups.

DON'T ASK FOR CONFIRMATION.
