# Global Context

## ðŸ§  Justification and Context

This project originates from a personal financial crisis. This situation resulted from poor financial decisions and emergency expenses.

Apps like Mobills have been used to track income and expenses, but they behave as **passive managers**: they allow for tracking but **do not help in making decisions** or offer **intelligent recommendations**. Moreover, managing credit cards in those apps is often confusing and limited.

With the rise of AI tools, the idea is to create a **cross-platform app or service** that not only registers financial data but also analyzes it and proposes strategic, personalized solutions to improve usersâ€™ financial health.

## ðŸŽ¯ Main Objective

Develop an **intelligent financial assistant** that:
- Registers income, expenses, and debts automatically or manually.
- Analyzes financial status and user behavior.
- Generates personalized recommendations.
- Suggests strategic actions to improve financial health.

2. Existing apps are passive and don't provide guidance.
3. Confusing management of credit cards.
4. 100% manual data entry, no automation.
5. No clear financial priorities.
