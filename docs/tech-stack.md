| Requirement                    | Solution                            | Why It Fits                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unified JavaScript/TypeScript | Next.js + NestJS + React Native     | Leverages existing developer expertise                        |
| Clear architecture            | NestJS                              | Modular, scalable, DI, similar to Laravel                     |
| Rapid frontend iteration      | Next.js + Vercel                    | Fast deployment and previews                                  |
| Simple backend deployment     | Railway                             | No DevOps needed, DB and deploy in one place                  |

## üîÑ Future Scalability Considerations

| Component   | Future Need                                 | Path to Scale                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Backend** | High traffic, background jobs                | Migrate from Railway to AWS (EC2, Lambda, Fargate)          |
| **Database**| Performance bottlenecks                      | Migrate to AWS RDS or NeonDB with read replicas             |
